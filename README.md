# Simple Random Forest(tm) in Java

[codebuff](https://github.com/antlr/codebuff) could really use a random forest so I'm playing with an implementation here.

**Limitations**

All `int` values but supports categorical and numerical values.

**References**

[ironmanMA](https://github.com/ironmanMA/Random-Forest) has some nice notes.
